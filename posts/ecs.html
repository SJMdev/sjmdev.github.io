## Developing an ECS 

### The World

!!! note
    Why not just use a vector of entities?
We want data locality in order to prevent cache misses. However, what I am currently unsure about is whether we want similar entities (i.e. entities with shared components) close to each other, or an array of components, where each entity only has a pointer to the component.


### Entities 
the gist of the ECS is that an Entity is dumb. It has an ID by which it is referred. it also has components. I am currently envisioning it as a vector of type `Component` (more like a set of components). users can specify a `System` for some types of components. i.e. if there is a component `Health`, it allows us to create a `System` (a function) that updates the health, or knows what do to if the component is there for an entity.


## Particle effects 
I have always been enamored with particle effects in games, especially when well done. The bomb cloud from the wind waker is one of my favorite effects of all time.
You can see the effect recreated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IrCggoJCno). In the coming weeks, I will be trying to recreate the effects myself according to this guide (which seems like a proper introduction to the subject).
Furthermore, I want to create some sort of `Window` where I can play the particle effect.  

Steps already taken:
1. Installing blender
2. Create a plane which emits particles!

The result can be seen in in the following figure:

TODO:
3. Change the particles to something else.
4. Try to figure out whether the files can be exported.

## Lua Scripting
Similar to the configuration problems we faced in the bachelor thesis, I was always interested in the drag'n'drop programming interfaces like in unity or the unreal engine. In these engines, the developer can write some script (e.g. for movement)
and this script is then in some way converted to actual code? It seemed like magic to me. I vaguely knew of the term JIT compilation, but never really knew what that meant. I dabbled with lua scripting in the source engine for Dota 2 (specifically trying to recreate
my favorite Heroes of Newerth Hero, Chipper). I recently saw a blog about creating and using lua bindings in c++ (click [here](https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/lua_cpp_binder/). Additionally, [this](https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/using-lua-and-cpp-in-practice/) blog contains some real world
examples of using lua in c++.

### installing the lua libraries on windows.
There is a simple executable installer which you can grab off any search engine. This installs all the libraries and include folders etc.

setting up a visual studio project that can use lua takes a bit. In essence, you need to include this at the top of your file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
extern "C" {
    # include "lua.h"
    # include "lauxlib.h"
    # include "lualib.h"
    }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because  all the lua libraries are written in C.

Furthermore, in the project's settings, you need to 
1. Include the lua libraries themselves (by adding them to the "include" directories)
2. Include the lua DLLs (by adding them to the "linker libraries")
3. Adding "lua.5.1.lib" to the included libraries 

Now, it sort of works. Additionally, I now sort of understand how useful template metaprogramming is: It allows you to dynamically create datatypes that we read in from the lua file.

next step is creating dynamic functions.
