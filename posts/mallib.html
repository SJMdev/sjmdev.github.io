# Mallib

## Conventions

This is an overview of all the conventions I (try to) adhere to in the `mallib` project.

(###) Keep it Super Simple, Super Stupid

As I mention in the [Ideas about Programming](ideas_about_programming.html), the compositional-style Object Oriented Programming quickly devolves in some sort of `World`-object in which all other objects live. This is then further complicated when certain types depend on the existence of some other types, or worse, certain objects have a reciprocal relation at different levels of the object hierarchy. More specifically, sometimes changes or events need to bubble upwards from the lower-level objects to higher level objects, which require lower-level objects to know of the existence of the higher-level object. However,
this warrants the use of pointers and this eventually leads to some sort of unmanagable entangled hierarchy.

!!! note
    Not every OOP project has to devolve to unmanagable entangled hierarchy problems, but most of the projects I ever worked on suffer from this exact problem.

I suffered from this in the initial start of the `mallib` project. It's called [ECS2](https://www.github.com/sjmdev/ECS2). The `Window` class contains a `Scene`, but also all the buffers for OpenGL to work with, but then also the `Objects` it needs to render to the screen. At a certain point, I just did not know how to properly split it up, or how to continue without endless refactoring of what I was doing. So I started over. 

During this period, I watched a lof of Jonathan Blow's livestreams on his game / his language. He uploads bite-sized chunks of his problem solving in the game development / game engine development domain. What struck me is how simple the code was that he wrote. Not that the functions are necessarily short, but more that the actual structure of the function and the function names were so indicative of what they were doing. I was inspired by the structure and simplicity of his codebase, and wanted to start over. The language his engine is written in, `Jai`, is close enough to any low-level language you can think of. However, the language is strictly procedurally oriented (i.e. there are no member functions). There is operator overloading (more specifically, definition?) allowed for certain types (Types such as `Vec3` or `Mat4x4`), where these operators can help express intent (as they are based in mathetmatics / linear algebra). Additionally, the language makes heavy use of polymorphic functions and reflection. While polymorphism and inheritance are normally tightly
intertwined, inheritance in Jai is not possible at all. This prevents the user from shooting themselves in the foot. Polymorphism is achieved through templating (similar as in `C++`), as well as clean macro expansion (I'll talk about this another time).

Long story short: the way in which that codebase was structured inspired me start over and restructure the code as as simple as possible. I am avoiding classes with member functions, and only using `POD` structs (both `std::is_trivially_constructable` and `std::is_standard_layout`). Furthermore, I am defining namespaces for certain types of `modules` (think `graphics`, `sound`, `math`). This restructuring has helped me enormously in trying to express my solution to any particular problem in the simplest way. While the application is not doing much yet, I am so much happier working on the codebase and gradually adding to it than I was before. 


----------------------------------------

(###) Almost Always Auto, but actually Sometimes Auto

`auto` is very useful for iterators, as it allows us to just use list iteration syntax, preventing the user from over / underflowing. However, some people strive towards the Almost Always Auto convention, as necessarily, every variable needs to be initialized. Sometimes the user does not care for the type (which is also the case for iterators).
~~~~~~~~~~
auto x = int{3}; // designating the type of literals
auto car_name = std::string("hello"); // explicit constructor invocation
auto cars = std::vector<Car>{a,b,c}; // list initialization with type information

for (auto &car: cars){} // Iteration by reference over every car.
auto my_car = make_unique<Car()>; // The type can be inferred by the function.

// We don't really care for the type, we just want to use it.
const auto& car_map_reference = car::complicated_stl_map_type_with_cars();
~~~~~~~~~~

The convention that I adopted is to use `auto` in places where a constructor call is necessary. The use of auto in these cases forces us to specify a specific constructor. Furthermore, using `auto` for iteration prevents a whole host of over- and underflow mistakes. In almost every case, we want to iterate over the entire array. The way it is expressed here does exactly that. We do not need a `size_t idx` and iterate by index. Finally, I use auto for reference types where I don't necessarily care for the type (e.g. a reference to a map of string and a particular type).

In cases where an object can be trivially constructed (e.g. `Vec3`), I use zero initialization. This means all fields of the `POD` type are set to 0 initially, and we can still be explicit about the initialization.
~~~~~~~~~
Vec3 color = {}; // zero initialization.
~~~~~~~~~

(###) Static Singletons for Simple Sharing

In the early stages of the project, I needed (still do) access to data on the heap. A recurring problem I keep running into is that I have difficulty knowing what goes where. More specifically, I have trouble pinpointing whose responsibility it is to create and clean up certain objects, especially objects that are shared between multiple classes / namespaces. As decribed in the [Thesis section](thesis.html), I thought about using the `extern` pattern. The problem with that is that it still needs to live somewhere. A way to remediate this for now is by the use of `static` singletons. Let's imagine that we have some sort of asset loading / management loading facility. For simplicity's sake, This is defined as the following:

~~~~~~~~~~
// namespace.h
namespace asset
{
	// content goes here.
}
~~~~~~~~~~
Imagine that this `asset` has some functionality to load all `obj` (model) files from a certain folder. For simplicity's sake, these Model files are stored in a `std::map&lt;std::string, Model&gt;` object.  In this example , `Model` is just some object that contains all the data originally in the  It would thus offer functionality similar to 

~~~~~~~~~~
// namespace.h
namespace asset
{
	// ignore the return type here, just an example!
	void load_models_from_folder(std::map&lt;std::string, Model&gt;& models, const std::string& folder_name);
}
~~~~~~~~~~
The specific problem given this example is: Where does the `std::map&lt;std::string, Model&gt; models` live? Who created it? Who is responsible for deleting it? (While not really necessary in the case of a game engine, but it is still a valid question).

I firmly believe that the more I work on the engine, the more clear and concise the problem statement becomes. Therefore, I opted to use the following pattern:

~~~~~~~~~~
// namespace.h
namespace asset
{
	// ignore the return type here, just an example!
	void load_Models_from_folder(std::map&lt;std::string, Model&gt;& models, const std::string& folder_name);

	std::map&lt;std::string, Model&gt;& models();
}

// namespace.cc
std::map<std::string, Model>& asset::models()
{
	static std::map&lt;std::string, Model&gt; models;
	return models;
}
~~~~~~~~~~
This means that the namespace can provide a reference to this `static` model map. I believe that since c++17, these are guaranteed to be initialized before anything else (or at least, before we can return a reference). 
I need to do some more research, but I believe accessing these is threadsafe (however, that of course comes at a cost). For now, it is the simplest solution to a problem I don't know yet how to solve once and for all.
