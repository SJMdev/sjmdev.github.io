## Dealing with openGL

### Layout Qualifiers

Layout qualifiers are very useful. They can be used as an extra guarantee to force uniform binding values as well as providing a way of matching in/output without relying on name matching or just alignment matching.

An example of a `test.vertex` could be: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
// Specify the input locations of attributes
layout (location = 0) in vec3 position_in;
layout (location = 1) in vec2 texture_coordinates_in;
layout (location = 2) in vec3 normal_in;

// Specify the Uniforms of the vertex shader
layout (location = 0) uniform mat4 projection_matrix;
layout (location = 1) uniform mat4 model_matrix;
layout (location = 2) uniform mat4 view_matrix;
layout (location = 3) uniform mat3 normal_transform;

// Specify the output of the vertex stage
layout (location = 0) out vec3 position_fs;
layout (location = 1) out vec2 texture_coordinates_fs;
layout (location = 2) out vec3 normal_fs;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input of the fragment shader can be defined as 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
// in
layout (location = 0) in vec3 position_fs;
layout (location = 1) in vec2 texture_coordinates_fs;
layout (location = 2) in vec3 normal_fs;

layout (location = 9)  uniform vec4 light_position; // in world coordinates, methinks.
layout (location = 10) uniform vec3 light_color;
layout (location = 11) uniform vec4 material; // , x = kd, y = ks, z = n, w = ka

// out
layout (location = 0) out vec4 fColor;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! note
    The uniform and input layout qualifiers are independent of each other. They can share values between them.


What can quickly become problematic is the overlap between uniform values in the same shader pipeline. I don't know yet 
how to prevent this. Maybe OpenGL is aware of this.

An approach that I could also take is use some sort of opengl "include", where all uniforms are defined with unique layout qualifiers.
