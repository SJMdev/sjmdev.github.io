# Slang
In my free time, I've been working on some concepts of a programming language. This came to be partly by working on the `mallib` project, as well as my frustration with the tools available to me in programming today. These ideas are not big-agenda-type ideas, but more conceptual. 
I'm not even sure if I am designing a language or an API.

## Core concepts

### Systems - Init, Alloc, Loop, Shutdown

### Threads - System Allocation, Workers

### Tasks -  Worker Queue submission
